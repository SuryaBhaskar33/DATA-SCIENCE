4. AT&T was running commercials in 1990 aimed at luring back customers who had switched to one of the other long-distance phone service providers. One such commercial shows a businessman trying to reach Phoenix and mistakenly getting Fiji, where a half-naked native on a beach responds incomprehensibly in Polynesian. When asked about this advertisement, AT&T admitted that the portrayed incident did not actually take place but added that this was an enactment of something that “could happen.” Suppose that one in 200 long-distance telephone calls is misdirected. What is the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number? (Assume independence of attempts.)

Answer:

Given that, one in 200 long-distance telephone calls is misdirected and To find that probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number

· Probability of call misdirecting (p)=1/200

· Probability of call not Misdirecting (q)= 1-1/200=199/200

· No of calls(n)=5

P(x)= ⁿCₓ*pˣ*qⁿ⁻ˣ

at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number

=1-none of the call reaches to wrong number

=1-P (0)

=1- ⁿC0*(1/200) ^0*(199/200)^5-0

=1-(199/200)^5

=0.02475

probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number =0.02475

1.	The time required for servicing transmissions is normally distributed with  = 45 minutes and  = 8 minutes. The service manager plans to have work begin on the transmission of a customer’s car 10 minutes after the car is dropped off and the customer is told that the car will be ready within 1 hour from drop-off. What is the probability that the service manager cannot meet his commitment? 

A.	0.3875   
B.	0.2676   
C.	0.5   
D.	0.6987 
Answer:
           = 45
          = 8
        Since work begins after 10 min, so the time left to repair is 50 min.
Probability that the service manager cannot meet his commitment=1-probability that the Service manager meet his commitment
P(X>50) =1-P(X<50)

3.	If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) and X2 ~ N(μ, σ2) are iid normal random variables, then what is the difference between 2 X1 and X1 + X2? Discuss both their distributions and parameters.       
Answer:
2 X 1 = N(2μ, 4σ 2 )
X 1 + X 2 = N(µ+µ, σ^+σ^2 ) = N(2µ, 2σ^2 )
Sum of normally distributed random variables are normally distributed.
2X1 –( X 1 + X 2 ) = N(2μ, 4σ^2 ) - N(2μ, 2σ^2 ) = N(6,σ^2 )
4.	Let X ~ N (100, 202). Find two values, a and b, symmetric about the mean, such that the probability of the random variable taking a value between them is 0.99. 

A.	90.5, 105.9

5.	Consider a company that has two different divisions. The annual profits from the two divisions are independent and have distributions Profit1 ~ N(5, 32) and Profit2 ~ N(7, 42) respectively. Both the profits are in $ Million. Answer the following questions about the total profit of the company in Rupees. Assume that $1 = Rs. 45
Answer:
Division1 = Profit1 ~ N (5, 3^2) = N (Ẋ1=5, S1^2= 3^2) 
Division2 = Profit2~ N (7, 4^2) = N (Ẋ2=7, S2^2 = 4^2)
µ = Company = (Profit1 + Profit2) = Mean Profit of Diivision1 + Division2= 5 + 7 = 12
Mean Profit of Company in rupees = 12 * 45 = 540 million

A.	Specify a Rupee range (centered on the mean) such that it contains 95% probability for the annual profit of the company.
Answer:
               Variance of the Company Distribution =𝜎^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52
Standard Deviation of the Company Distribution = 𝜎 = √52 = 5
Confidence Level = CL = 0.95
Confidence Interval = CI cc= 540 ± 1.96(225) = (99,981) In Millions

B.	Specify the 5th percentile of profit (in Rupees) for the company
To calculate 5th percentile from Z table Zα/2= 0.05 = -1.645
5th percentile = µ - Zα/2= 0.05(𝜎)= 540 – 1.645(225) = 169.87 million

C.	Which of the two divisions has a larger probability of making a loss in a given year?
Probability of Company 1 Making Loss = P (X<0)
Zx1=0 = (0−225)/(135) = 1.667
Probability at x < 0 = P(Zx1=0) = 0.0485 = 4.85%
Probability of Company 2 Making Loss = P (X<0)
Zx2=0 = (0−315)/ (180) = −1.75
Probability at x < 0 = P(Zx2=0) = 0.0401 = 4.01%
Therefore, Company 1 has High Probability of Making a loss in a given year

5.	In January 2005, a company that monitors Internet traffic (WebSideStory) reported that its sampling revealed that the Mozilla Firefox browser launched in 2004 had grabbed a 4.6% share of the market.

I.	If the sample were based on 2,000 users, could Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market?
Answer:
Assume null hypothesis: H0: p>5%
Alternate hypothesis: Ha: p<5%
 
 As (p_value = 0.2058) > (α = 0.05) ; Accept Null Hypothesis i.e. Mozilla market share > 5% Thus, Microsoft cannot conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market

II.	WebSideStory claims that its sample includes all the daily Internet users. If that’s the case, then can Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market?
Answer:
We are given that Web Side Story claims that its sample includes all the daily
Internet users. This means that the 4.6% is the population percentage. Comparing it with
Microsoft&#39;s claim that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the whole market is True. Hence,
we can conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market.

Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
A) Expected number of candies = ∑x.p(x) =1×0.015+4×0.20+3×0.65+5×0.005+6×0.01+2×0.120=0.015+0.8+1.95+0.025+0.06+0.24=3.09

	For Points,Score,Weight
Find Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Range and also Comment about the values/ Draw some inferences.
A)
   
	Points	Score	Weigh	Inference
Mean	3.59	3.21	17.84	More number of observations near mean
Median	3.69	3.32	17.71	Median is not influenced by outliers.
Mode	3.07,3.92(bimodal)	3.44	17.02,18.90	bimodal
Range (Max-Min)	2.17	3.91	8.4	It is the spread between highest and lowest values.
Variance	0.28	0.94	3.16 	Variance of weigh is more, which means the data are far from the mean compared to points and score.
Standard deviation	0.53	0.97	1.78	Standard deviation tells how the spread of data around mean.

Q11) Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?
A)
For 94% confidence level:
 
For 98% confidence level:
 
For 96% confidence level:
 
Q12) Below are the scores obtained by a student in tests
34,36,36,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,41,42,42,45,49,56
	Find mean, median, variance, standard deviation.
	What can we say about the student marks?
A) 
 


2)
	The average student marks are 41
	Median value of student marks is 40.5
	Most of the students got 41 in the test
	

Q13) What is the nature of skewness when mean, median of data are equal?
	When mean= median, the data is normally distributed.

Q14) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median?
         A)  positive/right nonparametric skew
Q15) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?
         A)  Negative /left nonparametric skew
Q16) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data?
A)
	Distribution is leptokurtic (taller than normal distribution with same mean)
	Sharp peak 
	Flatter tails

Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?
A)
	Distribution is Platykurtic(flatter than normal distribution with same mean)
	Thin nails
	Less peaked

Q18) Answer the below questions using the below boxplot visualization.
 
What can we say about the distribution of the data?
A)
	The data is not normally distributed.
	Median of the data is 15.
	No outliers present

What is nature of skewness of the data?
	It is left skewed data.

What will be the IQR of the data (approximately)? 
A) IQR= Q3-Q1= 18-10=8

Q19) Comment on the below Boxplot visualizations?
 
Draw an Inference from the distribution of data for Boxplot 1 with respect Boxplot 2.
A)
	Both 1 and 2 are normally distributed
	Median is same for 1 and 2. Median= Q2= 50th percentile= 260
	IQR for boxplot 1 is less compared to boxplot 2, which means the middle 50% of data for boxplot 2 spread more than boxplot 1.

 	Median is not on the middle of the box.


“Not normally distributed.”

Q 24)   A Government company claims that an average light bulb lasts 270 days. A researcher randomly selects 18 bulbs for testing. The sampled bulbs last an average of 260 days, with a standard deviation of 90 days. If the CEO's claim were true, what is the probability that 18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days
Hint:
rcode   pt(tscore,df)
df  degrees of freedom
A)
Population mean =µ=270
Sample size = n=18
df= n-1=17
Sample mean =x ⃗=260
Sample standard deviation = s= 90
t score = (260-270)/ (90/√18)=-0.4714
 
  18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days= 0.3216=32.16%
